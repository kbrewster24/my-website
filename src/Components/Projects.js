              UNH Men’s soccer team to “scout” upcoming team. 
              Application uses AWS API gateway and lambda function to run a python script 
              which scrapes player statistical information from the upcoming teams’ website.
              Application displays player stats neatly on a front end using react, coaches
              are able to move player cards to simulate teams’ formation and add 
              additional scouting information to the player cards."
